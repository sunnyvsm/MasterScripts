steps to fix if solr service is down over multiple servers

What is Solr :  An opesource enterprise search project that has a very rich feature set that includes : faceted search,dynamic clustering, db integration, document handling, full text search,hit highlighting.  Solr is lucene with lipstick. 


Solr use case : So you want to search through data , need faster results, need features like autocomplete, hit highlighting , full text search but don’t want to tax your database then Solr is the way to go. 

How does it work :
 You connect it to the datasource (db,docs ..). It sources all the data in memory , shards it based on the key specified, parses it, tokenizes it and makes it ready for the querying. 


How do I troubleshoot it :
 Treat It like any other java app running on a servlet engine. Check out the Solr admin UI, it gives you logs , config details and topology on the UI. The logs are always pretty self explanatory. 

Some common issues and their fixes :
•		Unable to find the search data : Permission issue, make sure the owner of the app ( who every you running your app as) has access to the index. 
•		No leader found : Usually caused by n/w hiccups or other communication issue. In order to fix it,  stop the solr app ( tomcat) , remove the write.lock file ( I usually do this “find . -name write.lock -exec rm -rf {} \;” ) , start the app and wait for 10 min. 
•	        Unable to elect  a leader : Make sure you have 2n+1 nodes of zookeeper running were (n >= ]0 )
•	    no servers hosting shard :		
	- Stop all Solr instances 
	- Stop all Zookeeper instances 
	- Start all Zookeeper instances 
	- Start Solr instances one at a time. 


Important files :

•	solr.xml —>  Defines solr as an application (top level)
•	schema.xml —>  Describes the structure of the documents indexed.
•	solrconfig.xml —>  configure search and request handlers. Is usually never
