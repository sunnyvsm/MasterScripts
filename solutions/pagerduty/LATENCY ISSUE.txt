Take the following action if you see latency in the US-West or US-East Data Centers.
 
Let us take the e.g. for US-West
When there is latency you will get an alert - The latency on the ELB in US-West was at 1s or higher for the last 10 minutes


Use this dashboard - https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/dash/19993?live=true&from_ts=1408111456381&to_ts=1408115056381&tile_size=m to monitor AdServer performance in West if there is any latency related issue. See graph below.
 
The ELB Latency will probably over 1s (1000 ms) and co-relate this with the Contextual Targeting Timeout graph below.
If you see a spike in the latency and a spike in the timeouts then call the person-on-call and he will walk you through the action to be taken the first time. Record it for your team members. You will own it in future.
 
I have described the actions below this chart.

1.      Switch off contextual targeting
a.      Browse in S3 to the folder vg-configs/us-oregon/adserverconfig/AdserverDynamicConfig.config
b.      Download it
c.      Change EnableContextualTargeting="true" to EnableContextualTargeting="false"
d.      Verify the XML using a tool like http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_validator.asp
e.      Generate the new MD5 File.
f.      Upload the AdserverDynamicConfig.config followed by the AdserverDynamicConfig.md5
g.      To keep it simple we may just swap the files to avoid steps c to e
2.      Verify in a few minutes (can take up to 15) that the file is on the aderver in location C:\inetpub\wwwroot\TidalTv\Adserver2.0\ConfigurationFiles
3.      Verify that adserver logs are coming in C:\tidaltv\prod\EventLogs3.0\EventLogs\tsvAdserverLog
4.      Verify that there aren’t any errors related to the change C:\tidaltv\prod\EventLogs2.0\EventLogs\ERR
5.      Monitor that the latency goes down … the timeouts should go to close to ZERO since it should no longer be called.
a.      Note Datadog is atleast 5 minutes behind
b.      Use CloudWatch for near real time data
 
This will be changed to false.

Note –
