serve databases, some critical application services and websites. The Cybage team will soon have a Rackspace account enabled for them.

General Procedure to take care of a PagerDuty alert for a service hosted on a Rackspace instance:

Rackspace ticket email.
2. Log in to the host using "Remote Desktop Connection Manager" (if it's a Windows instance).
3. Access the "Services" console via "Control Panel" -> "Administrative Tools" -> Services.
4. Restart the failed service and ensure that it comes up.
5. Update the Rackspace ticket with the actions taken.
