Decisions about scaling need to be taken based on graphs seen on datadog dashboard
URL: https://app.datadoghq.com/screen/board
If there is a consistent latency spike (and too many 503 errors in the adjacent graph), it's the right time for
scaling up the instances. Identify the region and the AutoScaling Group Name and scale up the group using the
following sequence:

Browse to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2 -> AUTO SCALING -> Auto Scaling Groups -> Select the right AS Group
-> Right-Click and select Edit -> Modify the right fields to complete the scaling.
Will be needed to be done for the regions: US East, US West and EUS.
 
Scaling decisions are also based on the peak times for the regions:
US East Peak Time 4pm EST 12AM EST
US West Peak 6pm EST 2AM EST
EU Peak 12pm - 8pm

Need to send emails before/after scaling up and scaling down, to systems
