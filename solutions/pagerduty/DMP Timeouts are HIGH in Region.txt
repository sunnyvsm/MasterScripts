STEPS TO FIX

1. Identify the region in which the problem is being observed. Example: “DMP Timeouts are HIGH IN USE” indicates a problem in US-East.

2. Log in to the Management host mgmt.lucidmedia.com using any SSH client.

3. Access the relevant “HAProxy Statistics” dashboard for DMP hosts via a browser.

US-East: 	

US-West: http://usorlzpx01.lucidmedia.com:8162/lbstats

4. Select two hostnames randomly from the list DMP hostsunder the “dmp” section in this dashboard and execute the manage-deploy script on the Management Host for restarting the tomcat service on those hosts.

Example:

$ manage-deploy -a=restart-tomcat -s=usvalzrhprd01,usvalzrhprd02

5. Type "yes" to confirm or the script may time out. The progress of the script can be seen on the console.

6. After completion of the above step, wait for a while to check whether the alerts continue to occur. In case they do, then select the next two hosts from the “HAProxy Statistics” dashboard and execute the “manage-deploy’ script for them as mentioned in step 4.

7. Continue this procedure till the error alert stops occurring.
