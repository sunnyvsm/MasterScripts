Hi all, 

Yogesh and me had a skype call today with Sanjeev and below are the discussed points. Latter he will clarify in details about these. 

Short term Task - Verify the Logs in Ad Server
======================

We need to verify the Ad server Logs during the deployment

Basically the Ad servers are distributed in 4 Regions on AWS Videology Account.
          
o	N. Virginia
o	Oregon
o	Singapore
o	Tokyo
          
You Just have to go to the AWS Console and search phrase for prod logger - vdlgprd. You will able to see some instances. 

Logon to any of the server in the list. 

After getting the desktop go to the path - C:\tidaltv\prod\EventLogs3.0\EventLogs\tsvClickStream

Verify that the log tsvClickStream in the folder is getting refreshed frequently. 

For Tokyo Region currently they have 4 Ad instances. You need to verify all the instances as they are very important. 


How to resolve Pagerduty Alert - HealthCheck EMail
===================================

To resolve the issue login to the instance for which you are getting the alert. 

After login to the server go to the path -  C:\tidaltv\prod\cache

Verify the time stamp of the cache file for which you are getting alert. For eg: “CacheAgeMonitor FlightMediaPlacementPayoutCache”

If that is not updated one then go to Task Scheduler > Run the "Logger 1 Minute Pull" task. 

Verify again the time stamp after the task “Logger 1 Minute Pull” finished. If it's still showing the old time stamp then login to another server and copy that file FlightMediaPlacementPayoutCache.proto to the instance. 

As we did this task manually, we have to edit the file FlightMediaPlacementPayoutCacheMarker.txt in an editor and make some change in the file and save it. 

Then the alert should get resolved aromatically.
