SED AND REGULAR EXPRESSION

***NOTE
whenever you are trying to match number with multiple digit in sed use -E option to allcurly braces directly {}
we use curly braces to define the range of digits

if i want to match number from 1-5 numbers
then

sed -n 's/[0-9]\{1,5\}/p' filename # here we need to escape curly braces as -E option is not used
sed -En 's/[0-9]{1,5}/p' filename
